EVS is a web application intended to help equestrian non-profit organizations to
coordinate volunteers in their day-to-day operations. It is in ongoing
development with the support and supervision of
[Opportunity Hack](https://www.ohack.org/home).

## Development

EVS is built on Kent C. Dodd's [Epic Stack](https://www.epicweb.dev/epic-stack)
starter project. Most of the Epic Stack's [docs](https://github.com/epicweb-dev/
epic-stack/tree/main/docs) are applicable to this application with a few minor
deviations and discrepencies from changes made to Epic Stack over time.

For instructions on setting up this project in your local development see the
document [./docs/development.md](./docs/development.md) in this repo.

## Deployment

See this document for an overview of the deployment setup used by this project's
stack and how to configure it: <https://github.com/epicweb-dev/epic-stack/blob/main/docs/deployment.md>

For this application to function properly, the deployed database needs to be
seeded with some initial data. See the document [./docs/deployment.md](./docs/deployment.md)
in this repo for more information and instructions on how to do this.
